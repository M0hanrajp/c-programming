### Understanding the Right Shift Operation

1. **Binary Representation**:
   - Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2. For example, the binary number `0000 1001` (which is 9 in decimal) is composed of:
     - \(2^3\) (8) → 0
     - \(2^2\) (4) → 1
     - \(2^1\) (2) → 0
     - \(2^0\) (1) → 1

2. **Effect of Right Shift**:
   - When you apply the right shift operator (`>>`), you're moving all bits to the right by a specified number of positions. For a right shift by `1`:
     - The bits that were previously in lower positions (toward the right) move to higher positions (toward the left).
     - The rightmost bit (the LSB) is pushed out of the number.

3. **Why Discarding Occurs**:
   - **Concept of Division**: Right shifting a number by `1` position is equivalent to performing integer division of that number by \(2\). For example:
     - \(9 \div 2 = 4\) with a remainder of \(1\).
   - The remainder (the LSB, which is `1` in this case) is not needed for the integer result. When you're shifting bits, you are focused only on the integer part of the result.

### Example of Right Shift:

1. **Original Value**: `9` in binary is `0000 1001`.
2. **Right Shift by 1**: 
   ```
   0000 1001  (Original)
   ↓
   0000 0100  (After shifting)
   ```
3. **Discarding the LSB**:
   - The bit that was previously `1` (the LSB) is now gone. This is because the operation is designed to represent the integer division by 2, where only the quotient is kept, and the remainder is disregarded.

### Summary

- The LSB is discarded in a right shift because the operation is meant to reflect the effect of division by 2, where only the quotient (integer part) is preserved, and any fractional part (or remainder) is lost.
- This behavior is fundamental to how binary arithmetic operates and is a deliberate design choice in programming languages to maintain consistency and efficiency in calculations.

The concept of division when using the right shift operator (`>>`) primarily applies when you are shifting by `1` position, which is equivalent to integer division by `2`. However, the right shift can be generalized for shifting by more than one position, and it can be understood through the same principles of binary representation and division.

### General Concept of Right Shifting

1. **Right Shift by n Positions**:
   - When you perform a right shift by `n` positions (e.g., `a >> n`), it is equivalent to performing integer division of the number by \(2^n\).
   - For example:
     - `a >> 2` is equivalent to `a / 4` (since \(2^2 = 4\))
     - `a >> 3` is equivalent to `a / 8` (since \(2^3 = 8\))

### Examples

Let’s consider a few examples to illustrate this:

#### Example 1: Right Shift by 2
- **Number**: `16`
- **Binary Representation**: `0001 0000` (16 in decimal)
- **Right Shift by 2**:
  - `16 >> 2` results in:
  ```
  0001 0000  (16 in binary)
  ↓↓
  0000 0100  (4 in binary)
  ```
  - **Equivalent Division**: `16 / 4 = 4` (where \(4\) is \(2^2\))

#### Example 2: Right Shift by 3
- **Number**: `24`
- **Binary Representation**: `0001 1000` (24 in decimal)
- **Right Shift by 3**:
  - `24 >> 3` results in:
  ```
  0001 1000  (24 in binary)
  ↓↓↓
  0000 0011  (3 in binary)
  ```
  - **Equivalent Division**: `24 / 8 = 3` (where \(8\) is \(2^3\))

### Summary of How Right Shift Works
- **Right Shift by n**: Each bit is shifted `n` positions to the right. This effectively divides the number by \(2^n\), dropping any fractional part (the bits that fall off to the right).
- **Integer Division**: The behavior mimics integer division:
  - `a >> n` = `a / 2^n`
- **Discarding Remainders**: As in standard integer division, any remaining bits (the LSBs that represent the remainder) are discarded.

The **left shift operator** (`<<`) works in the opposite way of the right shift operator. While right shifting divides a number by powers of 2, **left shifting multiplies the number by powers of 2** by shifting the bits to the left and adding zeros to the right.

### Concept of Left Shift (`<<`)

- **Left Shift by `n` Positions**: When you perform a left shift by `n` positions (`a << n`), it is equivalent to multiplying the number by \(2^n\).
  - **For example**:
    - `a << 1` is equivalent to `a * 2`
    - `a << 2` is equivalent to `a * 4` (since \(2^2 = 4\))
    - `a << 3` is equivalent to `a * 8` (since \(2^3 = 8\))

### How Left Shift Works

Let’s see some examples to illustrate how this works:

#### Example 1: Left Shift by 1
- **Number**: `5`
- **Binary Representation**: `0000 0101` (5 in decimal)
- **Left Shift by 1**:
  - `5 << 1` shifts the bits one position to the left, filling in `0` on the right.
  ```
  0000 0101  (5 in binary)
  ↓
  0000 1010  (10 in binary)
  ```
  - **Equivalent Multiplication**: `5 * 2 = 10`

#### Example 2: Left Shift by 2
- **Number**: `3`
- **Binary Representation**: `0000 0011` (3 in decimal)
- **Left Shift by 2**:
  - `3 << 2` shifts the bits two positions to the left, adding two `0`s on the right.
  ```
  0000 0011  (3 in binary)
  ↓↓
  0000 1100  (12 in binary)
  ```
  - **Equivalent Multiplication**: `3 * 4 = 12` (since \(2^2 = 4\))

### Summary of Left Shift Behavior

- **Left Shift by `n` Positions**: Each bit is shifted `n` positions to the left, and `n` zeros are added to the rightmost positions.
- **Multiplication**: A left shift of `n` positions multiplies the original number by \(2^n\).
  - `a << 1` = `a * 2`
  - `a << 2` = `a * 4`
  - `a << 3` = `a * 8`, and so on.
- **Overflow**: In case the number becomes too large to fit in the available bit width (e.g., 32 bits or 64 bits), the most significant bits (leftmost bits) will be discarded. This is known as **overflow**.

### Example of Overflow (Optional)

If you're working with a 4-bit system, the number `6` (`0110` in binary) left-shifted by 1 would look like:
- `0110 << 1` becomes `1100` (which is 12 in decimal).
- But if you left-shift it again (`0110 << 2`), you would get `1000`, which is 8, and shifting more could cause bits to overflow, leading to unexpected results.

### Conclusion

- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Multiplies the number by powers of 2.
  - Each shift left doubles the number.
  - Equivalent to \( a \times 2^n \).
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Divides the number by powers of 2.
  - Each shift right halves the number, discarding the remainder.


Great questions! Let's address them one by one.

### 1. **Overflow on a 64-bit System**

If you're working on a 64-bit system, overflow can still occur, but it depends on how large the number is and how far you're shifting. Overflow happens when you try to shift bits beyond the limits of the data type you're using, such as `int`, `long`, or `long long`. Here’s how it works:

- **Data Types and Their Sizes**:
  - On a 64-bit system, the size of an `int` is typically **32 bits**.
  - A `long` or `long long` is typically **64 bits**.

Even if you have a 64-bit system, overflow can occur if you are shifting beyond the limits of the data type, not just the system architecture.

#### Example of Overflow with 32-bit `int`:
Suppose you have a 32-bit `int` with the binary value `0110 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001` (this is `1,610,612,737` in decimal). If you shift it left by, say, 3 positions (`<< 3`):
- Before the shift: `0110 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001`
- After the shift:  `0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000`

In this case, the most significant bits (those on the left) that get pushed out are **discarded**, resulting in an **overflow** for values larger than what can be represented by the data type.

#### Overflow for a 64-bit `long`:
For a 64-bit `long`, you won’t see overflow until you shift far enough for bits to "overflow" out of the 64-bit range. If you shift a value left by 64 or more positions, you will always end up with `0`, since the bits will be completely shifted out of the number.

### 2. **Zeros Are Added When Doing a Right Shift?**

This depends on the **type of right shift** and whether the number is **signed** or **unsigned**:

- **Logical Right Shift (`>>`)**: 
  - This is typically used with **unsigned** numbers. When performing a logical right shift, **0's are always added** to the left (most significant side) as you shift the bits to the right.
  - Example:
    ```
    0000 1001  (9 in decimal)
    0000 0100  (4 in decimal after right shift by 1)
    ```
    - Here, a `0` was added to the leftmost position when the bits shifted right.

- **Arithmetic Right Shift (`>>`)** (with signed integers):
  - For signed integers, an arithmetic right shift fills the leftmost bit with the **sign bit** (the bit that indicates whether the number is positive or negative).
  - If the number is **positive**, `0's` will be added from the left.
  - If the number is **negative**, `1's` will be added from the left to maintain the sign.

#### Example of Arithmetic Right Shift with Negative Number:
Let’s take `-9` (in 8-bit representation) as an example:
- Binary representation of `-9` (using **two's complement**): `1111 0111`
- If you perform an arithmetic right shift by 1 (`>> 1`):
  ```
  1111 0111  (-9 in binary)
  ↓
  1111 1011  (-5 in binary)
  ```
  - The leftmost `1` was maintained (since the number is negative) to preserve the sign.

### Summary:
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Shifts bits left and fills with `0's` on the right. Multiples the number by powers of 2. Overflow can still occur if you shift more bits than the size of the data type allows.
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**:
  - **Logical Right Shift** (for unsigned types): Adds `0's` on the left.
  - **Arithmetic Right Shift** (for signed types): Adds `0's` on the left for positive numbers and `1's` for negative numbers to preserve the sign.

### Overflow on a 64-bit System:
Even on a 64-bit system, overflow can happen, but only if the value you're shifting exceeds the limit of the data type. For example, shifting a 64-bit `long` too many positions will still result in overflow.
