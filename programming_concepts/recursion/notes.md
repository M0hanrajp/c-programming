## üìà How to Use This Roadmap

1. **Start Small** (Basic tier) until you can mentally trace every call.
2. **Dry-Run & Debug**: write recursion trees on paper or use print statements.
3. **Analyze Complexity**: for each solution, derive its time/space cost.
4. **Add Memoization**: revisit basic problems (e.g. Fibonacci) and optimize.
5. **Mix in Challenges**: on days you feel confident, pick 1‚Äì2 advanced problems.

- Base Case: When to stop recursing.
- Recursive Case: How the problem reduces to a smaller subproblem.
- Call Stack Understanding: What happens under the hood when functions call themselves.
