Error 1: `||` operator doesn't work within a `case` label.
```bash
# this is not allowed
case ('a' || 'A):
    count++;
```
Correct way:
```c
switch (sentence[index]) {
    case 'a':
    case 'A':
        count++;
        break;
    // Add other cases as needed
}
```
#### Explanation:
- Each `case` label compares `sentence[index]` against a single character.
- When the character is `'a'` or `'A'`, it will execute the code under both `case` labels (since there's no `break` between them). This is called "fall-through."
- `count++` will be executed if either `case 'a'` or `case 'A'` matches.
