Error 1: `||` operator doesn't work within a `case` label.
```bash
# this is not allowed
case ('a' || 'A):
    count++;
```
Correct way:
```c
switch (sentence[index]) {
    case 'a':
    case 'A':
        count++;
        break;
    // Add other cases as needed
}
```
#### Explanation:
- Each `case` label compares `sentence[index]` against a single character.
- When the character is `'a'` or `'A'`, it will execute the code under both `case` labels (since there's no `break` between them). This is called "fall-through."
- `count++` will be executed if either `case 'a'` or `case 'A'` matches.

Error 2: String literals cannot be used in case statements.
- The switch statement in C only works with integral or enumerated types (like int, char, enum). String literals are not valid in this context because they are pointers to arrays of characters, not constant integral values.
