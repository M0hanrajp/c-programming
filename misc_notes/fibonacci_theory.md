The Fibonacci series is a mathematical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It is named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, who introduced this sequence to Western mathematics in his book *Liber Abaci* in 1202.

### Properties of the Fibonacci Series
1. **Starting Numbers**:
   - The sequence begins with **0** and **1**.
   - Some variations start with **1** and **1**.

2. **Recursive Nature**:
   - Each term is calculated by adding the two previous terms:  
     **F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)**.

3. **Sequence Example**:
   - Starting with 0 and 1:  
     **0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...**

Hereâ€™s the Fibonacci series presented in a horizontal table format for the first 19 numbers:

| **n**    | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17   | 18   |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|
| **F(n)** | 0  | 1  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 5  | 8  | 13 | 21  | 34  | 55  | 89  | 144 | 233 | 377 | 610 | 987 | 1597 | 2584 |

4. **Golden Ratio**:
   - As the Fibonacci sequence progresses, the ratio of consecutive terms approaches the **golden ratio** (~1.618).  
     This property is significant in mathematics, art, and nature.

5. **Applications**:
   - **Mathematics**: Studied in number theory and algorithm analysis.
   - **Nature**: Observed in patterns like sunflower spirals, pine cones, and shells.
   - **Computer Science**: Used in dynamic programming and algorithm design.
   - **Art and Architecture**: Inspires aesthetically pleasing designs.

6. **Historical Significance**:
   - Fibonacci introduced the sequence while solving a problem about rabbit population growth.

The Fibonacci series demonstrates fascinating properties that connect mathematics to natural patterns and structures, making it a fundamental concept in many disciplines.
