### Add numbers between given range a & b

To find the sum of a range of numbers from \(-1\) to \(2\), you can use the **arithmetic series formula**, provided the numbers form an arithmetic progression. 

The sum of arithmetic series is given by:

$$
S = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a + l)
$$

Where:
- n = number of terms in the range
- a = first term of the range
- l = last term of the range

$$
   S = \frac{4}{2} \cdot (-1 + 2)
$$
$$
   S = 2 \cdot 1 = 2
$$

#### Sum:
The sum of numbers from -1 to 2 is **2**.

In the situation where we need to find the number of terms :

#### Formula for the Number of Terms (\(n\)):
The number of terms in the range can be calculated as:
$$
n = \frac{l - a}{d} + 1
$$

Substitute the values:
$$
n = \frac{2 - (-1)}{1} + 1 = \frac{2 + 1}{1} + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4
$$

So, there are 4 terms in the range: (-1, 0, 1, 2).
