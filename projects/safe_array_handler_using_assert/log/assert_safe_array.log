Test 1: Initialize and Print
S_ARRAY[0] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9020
S_ARRAY[1] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9024
S_ARRAY[2] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9028
S_ARRAY[3] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd902c
S_ARRAY[4] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9030
Max array size: 5

Test 2: Set and Get valid elements
Set element at index 0 to 8
Set element at index 4 to 88
get_value at index (4): 88
get_value at index 4: 88
S_ARRAY[0] = 8 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9020
S_ARRAY[1] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9024
S_ARRAY[2] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9028
S_ARRAY[3] = 0 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd902c
S_ARRAY[4] = 88 stored at 0x5bd7fbfd9030
