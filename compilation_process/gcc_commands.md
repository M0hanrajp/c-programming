### Useful GCC Flags for Better Linker Error Reporting

1. **`-Wl,--trace`**:
   - This flag can be used to show the files and libraries that are being linked. It provides insight into the linking process and can help determine which files are included in the final executable.
   ```bash
   gcc -Wl,--trace main.c -o my_program
   ```
2. **`-g`**:
   - This flag generates debug information in the executable, which can be useful when debugging linking issues. It does not affect the linking process directly but can make it easier to use a debugger (like `gdb`) to analyze the program.
   ```bash
   gcc -g main.c -o my_program
   ```
3. **`-fPIC`**:
   - When creating shared libraries, use this flag to produce position-independent code. It’s useful if you’re linking against shared libraries and helps avoid certain linker errors related to addressing.
   ```bash
   gcc -fPIC -shared -o my_library.so my_library.c
   ```
4. **`-L` and `-l`**:
   - Use `-L` to specify directories for library search paths and `-l` to link against specific libraries. These can help resolve undefined references if your program is missing a library during linking.
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -L/path/to/lib -lmylibrary -o my_program
   ```
5. **`-Wl,--no-as-needed`**:
   - This linker flag forces the linker to include libraries even if they are not directly referenced, which can help resolve issues with undefined references that might be caused by optimization settings.
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -Wl,--no-as-needed -o my_program
   ```
6. **`-fno-common`**:
   - This flag can help detect linker issues related to multiple definitions of the same variable. By default, GCC allows common symbols, but using this flag can catch potential problems earlier.
   ```bash
   gcc -fno-common main.c -o my_program
   ```
7. **Verbose Linking**:
   - You can also make the linker verbose to see exactly what it is doing during the linking process:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wl,--verbose main.c -o my_program
   ```
8. **`-v`**:
- **Description**: Enables verbose output.
- **Usage**: Shows the commands being executed by GCC, including linking commands. This can help identify where errors occur during the linking stage.
- **Example**: 
  ```bash
  gcc -v your_file.c
  ```
9. **`-fverbose-asm`**:
- **Description**: Generates more verbose assembly output.
- **Usage**: This can help you see more details in the assembly output, which can be useful for debugging.
- **Example**: 
  ```bash
  gcc -S -fverbose-asm your_file.c
  ```
### Example Command
Here’s an example command that combines some of the above flags:
```bash
gcc -g -Wl,--trace -L./libs -lmylibrary main.c -o my_program
```
