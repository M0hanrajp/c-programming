**Multi-Programming vs. Multi-Tasking Operating Systems - Detailed Notes**

## 1. Introduction
- **Multi-programming and Multi-tasking Operating Systems** are two fundamental types of OS that improve CPU utilization and responsiveness.
- **Multi-programming** focuses on maximizing CPU utilization by keeping multiple processes in memory.
- **Multi-tasking (Time-Sharing)** ensures that multiple tasks run concurrently by allocating time slices to each process.

## 2. Multi-Programming Operating System
### **2.1 Concept**
- On a single CPU.
- **First introduced** before multi-tasking.
- The idea is to **load multiple processes** into RAM so that the CPU always has a job to execute.
- The **goal is to reduce CPU idle time** by switching to another process when one is waiting for I/O.

### **2.2 Execution Process**
- The **CPU executes one process completely** before moving to the next.
- Execution is **non-preemptive**, meaning the CPU only switches if a process voluntarily moves to I/O.(Context switching)
- Switch	happens	when	current	process	goes	to	wait	state.
- Non-Preemptive Scheduling:
    - Once a process starts executing, it continues until it completes its task, voluntarily yields control, or encounters an event that causes it to wait (e.g., waiting for I/O).
    - Example: First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling, where processes are executed in the order they arrive.
    - Advantages:
        - Simplicity: Easier to implement and manage.
        - Reduced Overhead: Minimal context switching overhead.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Lack of Responsiveness: Can be unresponsive to high-priority tasks if a low-priority process is currently running.
        - Starvation: A long-running process can prevent other processes from getting access to the CPU. 
- **Scheduling is sequential**, following a **First Come, First Served (FCFS)** approach.

### **2.3 Example Analogy**
- Suppose **10 students** are in a classroom, each with **5 questions** to solve.
- A teacher (CPU) will **help Student1 solve all 5 questions** before moving to Student2, then Student3, and so on.
- If a student **needs a break (I/O request)**, the teacher moves to the next student.
- Once a student finishes their questions, they leave, and the next student gets their turn.

### **2.4 Advantages**
‚úÖ **Better CPU Utilization:** CPU is not idle when a process is waiting for I/O.
‚úÖ **Efficient for batch processing:** Suitable for systems where job completion time is not critical.
‚úÖ **Simple Scheduling:** Jobs are executed one after another without complex scheduling algorithms.

### **2.5 Disadvantages**
‚ùå **Long Waiting Time:** A process has to wait until the previous one completes.
‚ùå **Poor Responsiveness:** If one process takes too long, others have to wait longer.
‚ùå **No Pre-emption:** The OS does not interrupt a running process to switch to another.

## 3. Multi-Tasking (Time-Sharing) Operating System
### **3.1 Concept**
- On a single CPU
- Multi-tasking is **pre-emptive**, meaning that the CPU **allocates a fixed time slice** to each process.
- Preemptive Scheduling:
    - A process can be interrupted and suspended by the operating system, even if it's currently running, to allow a higher-priority process to access the CPU.
    - Round-robin scheduling, where each process gets a fixed time slice, and if it doesn't finish within that time, it's interrupted and the next process gets the CPU.
    - Advantages:
        - Flexibility: Allows the system to quickly respond to urgent tasks or high-priority events.
        - Fairness: Prevents a single process from monopolizing the CPU.
    - Disadvantages:
        - Overhead: Context switching (saving the state of the interrupted process and loading the state of the new process) can be computationally expensive.
        - Complexity: Requires a more complex scheduler.
- Processes **switch rapidly**, giving the illusion that they are running simultaneously.
- Used in **modern computing devices** like laptops, desktops, and mobile devices.
- Context	switching	and	time	sharing	used. Increases	responsiveness.

### **3.2 Execution Process**
- The **CPU executes each process for a fixed time slice** (e.g., 10ms per process).
- If a process **completes within its time slice**, it exits.
- If not, the OS **pre-empts (interrupts) the process** and schedules it for the next cycle.

### **3.3 Example Analogy**
- Suppose **10 students** are in a classroom, each with **5 questions**.
- The teacher (CPU) **helps Student1 with only 2 questions** and then moves to Student2, then Student3, and so on.
- After reaching the last student, the teacher **returns to Student1** to solve the remaining questions.
- This ensures that **each student gets attention frequently**, rather than waiting for their entire turn.

### **3.4 Advantages**
‚úÖ **Better Responsiveness:** Users don‚Äôt have to wait long for their processes to get CPU time.
‚úÖ **Efficient for real-time interaction:** Used in modern operating systems for smooth user experience.
‚úÖ **Allows fair CPU allocation:** Ensures every process gets some execution time.

### **3.5 Disadvantages**
‚ùå **Overhead of Context Switching:** Frequent switching between processes increases overhead.
‚ùå **Complex Scheduling Algorithms:** Requires time-sharing algorithms like **Round Robin**.
‚ùå **Not Always Optimal for CPU Utilization:** Switching too frequently may waste CPU cycles.

```bash
# Mutliprogramming
+--------------------------------+
|            RAM                 |
+--------------------------------+
|  P1  |  P2  |  P3  |  P4       |  <-- Multiple processes in memory
+--------------------------------+

Execution Timeline:

CPU ---> [ P1 Running ] ---> (P1 needs I/O) ---> [ CPU Idle ] ---> [ P2 Running ] ---> [ P3 Running ]
                 |                                |
           Disk Access                     Disk Access

Disadvantages:
- CPU idle time is high** due to I/O waits.
- Slow response time** since one process must finish before the next starts.

# Multitasking/ Timesharing
+--------------------------------+
|            RAM                 |
+--------------------------------+
|  P1  |  P2  |  P3  |  P4       |  <-- Multiple processes in memory
+--------------------------------+

Execution Timeline (Round-Robin Scheduling):

Time ---> [ P1 for 2ms ] --> [ P2 for 2ms ] --> [ P3 for 2ms ] --> [ P4 for 2ms ]
           |                      |                     |
     (P1 needs I/O)         (P2 continues)       (P3 needs I/O) 
           |                      |                     |
     [ P2 runs next ]       [ P4 runs next ]       [ P1 resumes ]

Advantages:
- Fast response time** because every process gets CPU time frequently.
- CPU never stays idle** since it quickly switches to another task
- Example: Windows, Linux (Desktop)
