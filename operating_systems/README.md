### Operating systems

#### **1. Basic Introduction**
- **Definition of an Operating System**.
- **Types of Operating Systems**:
  - Batch OS
  - Multiprogramming OS
  - Multitasking OS
  - Real-time OS

---

#### **2. Process Management**
- **Process Diagram**:
  - Describes the various states a process goes through during execution.
- **System Calls**:
  - Important system calls like `fork()` and `kernel system calls`.
- **Process Scheduling (CPU Scheduling)**:
  - Includes several algorithms:
    - **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
    - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
    - **Preemptive Scheduling**
    - **Round Robin Scheduling**

---

#### **3. Process Synchronization**
- Focuses on how multiple processes coordinate.
- **Concept of Semaphore**.

---

#### **4. Deadlock & Threads**
- **Deadlock**:
  - Definition and conditions leading to deadlocks.
  - Deadlock **prevention & avoidance techniques**.
  - **Banker’s Algorithm**
- **Threads**:
  - Two types of threads:
    - **Kernel-level threads**
    - **User-level threads**
  - Mainly a theoretical topic.

---

#### **5. Memory Management**
- **Paging** – basic concepts.
- **Segmentation** – how it works.
- **Fragmentation** – internal & external fragmentation.
- **Virtual Memory**:
  - **Numerical questions** on *Effective Memory Access Time*.
  - **Thrashing** concept.
- **Page Replacement Algorithms** (important for exams):
  - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
  - **Optimal Page Replacement**

---

#### **6. Disk Scheduling**
- Algorithms covered:
  - **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
  - **SCAN Algorithm**
  - **C-SCAN Algorithm**

---

#### **7. UNIX Commands**
- More relevant for **UGC NET** than GATE.
- Covers **basic Linux commands**, such as:
  - `ls` (list directory)
  - `mkdir` (make directory)
  - `cd` (change directory)
  - `chmod` (change file permissions)
- **System calls related to file handling** `open()` like..

---

#### **8. File Management & Security**
- **File Access Methods**:
  - **Sequential Access**
  - **Random Access**
  - **Linked Access**
- **Security Topics**:
  - **Viruses**
  - **Vulnerabilities**
  - **Encryption basics**
  - **Types of attacks**
